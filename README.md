# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
Step 1:
Using import math function,do the calculations.

Step 2:
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.

Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula

formula

Step 4:
using the print function, display the distance between the two points.

Step 5:
End the program.

import math
x1 = 10
x2 = 4
y1 = 6
y2 = 2
d = math.sqrt(((x2-x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2))
print("%.2f" % d)
```
  


### OUTPUT:
